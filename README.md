My website built using the Nuxt [content module](https://content.nuxtjs.org/), a git-based headless CMS.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# generate static project
$ yarn generate

# view a production version of your app
$ yarn start
```
