Here is a demonstration of the Stereoscopic camera gimbal I built. The 3-axis gimbalâ€™s motion is synchronized to an Oculus Rift. I constructed the gimbal hardware with Actobotics parts and Hitec Servos from [ServoCity.com](https://servocity.com).

Here is a longer video where I narrate and explain how the device works.
